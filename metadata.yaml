description: Though not exactly a mystery in the traditional sense, Mary Roberts Rinehart's
  Where There's a Will certainly has its fair share of intrigue, chicanery and deception.
  At stake is the ownership of Hope Springs, a family-owned health resort whose future
  appears uncertain in the aftermath of the longtime manager's demise. When a well-meaning
  group of employees band together to try to take matters into their own hands, all
  hell breaks loose.
